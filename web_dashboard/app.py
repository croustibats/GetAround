    Welcome to this dashboard ! 

    ðŸš§ When using Getaround, drivers book cars for a specific time period, from an hour to a few days long. They are supposed to bring back the car on time, but it happens from time to time that drivers are late for the checkout.
    Late returns at checkout can generate high friction for the next driver if the car was supposed to be rented again on the same day : Customer service often reports users unsatisfied because they had to wait for the car to come back from the previous rental or users that even had to cancel their rental because the car wasnâ€™t returned on time. 

    ðŸŽ¯The goal of this dashboard is to determine a minimum delay between two rentals or at least give some hint on the trade-off of minimum delay. A car wonâ€™t be displayed in the search results if the requested checkin or checkout times are too close from an already booked rental.
      It solves the late checkout issue but also potentially hurts Getaround/owners revenues: we need to find the right trade off.

    By examining historical data gathered on the GetAround app we will try to answer these questions : 

    * How often are drivers late for the next check-in? How does it impact the next driver?
    * Which share of our ownerâ€™s revenue would potentially be affected by the feature?
    * How many rentals would be affected by the feature depending on the threshold and scope we choose?
    * How many problematic cases will it solve depending on the chosen threshold and scope?
